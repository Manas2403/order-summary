### What I learned

i learnt to use flexbox and a new font-family.


```css
.container-2{
    background: hsl(225, 100%, 98%);

    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: space-around;
    margin-bottom: 32px;
    *{
    box-sizing: border-box;
    font-family:  'Red Hat Display', sans-serif;
}


```
